   - System applies intelligent extraction methods based on content patterns
   - Domain-agnostic analysis without rigid structure constraints
   - Adaptive confidence assessment and quality metrics

2. **Phase 2: Policy Structure Application**
   - User-defined output formatting and variable constraints
   - Dynamic policy mapping based on organizational requirements
   - Runtime configuration without code changes
   - Fallback handling for missing or incomplete policies

3. **Universal Benefits**
   - Works for any domain: legal, medical, business, research, etc.
   - No hardcoded assumptions about content or structure
   - User-configurable extraction strategies and confidence thresholds
   - Completely adaptable to different organizations and workflows
