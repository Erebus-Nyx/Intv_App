## Hybrid Module Architecture Overview

### 🎯 **HYBRID APPROACH BENEFITS**
The new hybrid architecture combines the best of both Python-based intelligent analysis and JSON-based policy constraints:

1. **Phase 1: Python Intelligent Analysis**
   - Smart extraction methods for domain-specific content
   - Pattern recognition and context-aware processing
   - Flexible analysis without rigid structure constraints
   - Confidence assessment and quality metrics

2. **Phase 2: JSON Policy Structure**
   - Consistent output formatting per organizational requirements
   - Easy configuration updates without code changes
   - Policy compliance and standardization
   - User-configurable variables and hints

3. **Combined Benefits**
   - More accurate extraction than pure JSON templates
   - More consistent output than pure Python analysis
   - Configurable confidence thresholds and extraction strategies
   - Backward compatibility with existing JSON configurations

### 📊 **MODULE STATUS MATRIX**
| Module | Status | Version | Features Implemented | Confidence Threshold |
|--------|--------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Adult** | ✅ Complete | 2.0.0 | Personal info, employment, family, safety | 0.7 |
| **Casefile** | ✅ Complete | 2.0.0 | Case analysis, participants, timeline, legal | 0.7 |
| **Affidavit** | ✅ Complete | 2.0.0 | Legal elements, notary, formal structure | 0.75 |
| **Child** | 🔧 In Progress | 1.0.0→2.0.0 | Basic structure, needs extraction methods | 0.7 |
| **Collateral** | ❌ Missing | - | Needs creation with hybrid approach | TBD |
| **AR** | ❌ Missing | - | Needs creation with hybrid approach | TBD |

### 🏗️ **HYBRID ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS**
Each hybrid module includes:
- **Core Methods**: `_create_generic_summary()`, `_apply_policy_structure()` 
- **Configuration**: `_load_variables_config()`, `_convert_config_format()`
- **Extraction Methods**: 20-60 domain-specific analysis functions
- **Mapping System**: `_map_to_policy_variable()` for JSON compliance
- **Quality Assessment**: Confidence scoring and analysis quality metrics
- **Backward Compatibility**: Automatic conversion of old JSON formats
