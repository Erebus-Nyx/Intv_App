## Hybrid Module Architecture Overview

### 🎯 **HYBRID APPROACH BENEFITS**
The new hybrid architecture combines the best of both Python-based intelligent analysis and JSON-based policy constraints:

1. **Phase 1: Python Intelligent Analysis**
   - Smart extraction methods for domain-specific content
   - Pattern recognition and context-aware processing
   - Flexible analysis without rigid structure constraints
   - Confidence assessment and quality metrics

2. **Phase 2: JSON Policy Structure**
   - Consistent output formatting per organizational requirements
   - Easy configuration updates without code changes
   - Policy compliance and standardization
   - User-configurable variables and hints

3. **Combined Benefits**
   - More accurate extraction than pure JSON templates
   - More consistent output than pure Python analysis
   - Configurable confidence thresholds and extraction strategies
   - Backward compatibility with existing JSON configurations
